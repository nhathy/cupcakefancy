Writing for Cupcakefancy
============

Object-Oriented Cupcakes
---------------------
+	We're writing object-oriented cupcake recipes - each part of the cupcake is its own cupcake object that can be combined into full cupcakes
+	That means that to create a full cupcake recipe, you will actually create a few different cupcake objects, like cake batter, filling, frosting, toppings, and/or decorations, and then combine them in the full cupcake recipe.

File Formatting
---------------------
+	Please write your recipes in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
+	Please name your files with underscores_in_place_of_spaces so that links remain readable and aren't%20full%20of%20bullshit.
+	Give your files the .MD extension

Update the Index
---------------------
+	Once you have created all your various taco objects (even if it's just one) update the index so that it gets listed. While we do have people checking every now and then, you can help keep the index up-to-date by updating your stuff as part of your pull request.

Submit
---------------------
+	Submit a pull request.
+	We'll check it over, offer any suggestions if necessary (never about deliciousness, but possibly about formatting or because you forgot to update the index or something), and will then merge into master.
